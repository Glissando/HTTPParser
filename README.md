# HTTPParser
 Final Project for OOP Spring 2020

This a custom parser for parsing through html-like files made for my spring 2020 Object Oriented Programming class. As part of this class I utilized several concept in python from the book Starting Out with python 3rd edition.

## Decision Structures and Boolean Logic(Chapter 3)
Decision structures where used to determine the type of element currently being parsed through, whether it was an opening tag, closing tag or self closing tag.

## Functions (Chapter 5)
There is a function written to handle each different part of the syntax. Attribute parsing, tag parsing and self closing tags all have their own respective functions for handling them.

## Files and Exceptions (Chapter 6)
File loading is used to grab the html tag to parse

## Lists and Tuples (Chapter 7)
Tokens are stored in a list as they are parsed.

## Dictionaries and Sets (Chapter 9)
Attributes are stored as a dictioanry
